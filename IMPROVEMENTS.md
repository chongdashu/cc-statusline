# Unix-Prompt Theme Improvements

## Features Added

### 1. Unix Shell Prompt Format
- Traditional `user@hostname /path $` format as first element
- Classic terminal colors (red user, yellow @, cyan host, yellow path, purple $)
- Provides immediate context awareness

### 2. Compact 2-Line Layout  
- **Line 1**: Shell prompt + Git branch + Model info + Version + Style
- **Line 2**: All metrics combined (Context + Session + Cost + Tokens)
- Reduces from 3 lines to 2 (33% space savings)

### 3. Anti-Flicker Caching System
- **Output caching**: 2-second cache to prevent flicker on rapid updates
- **Input hash checking**: Only regenerates when input actually changes
- **ccusage throttling**: Updates expensive ccusage data only every 10 seconds
- Result: Smooth, flicker-free statusline with reduced system load

### 4. Subtle Professional Colors
- Muted grayscale palette (240-246 range) for all metrics
- Non-distracting colors that don't dominate the terminal
- Context colors adjust subtly based on remaining percentage
- Professional appearance suitable for work environments

### 5. Smart Number Formatting
- Large tokens: "2.5M" instead of "2547891"
- TPM rates: "96Ktpm" instead of "95842 tpm"  
- Reduces cognitive load and improves readability

## Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Update frequency | Every keystroke | Cached 2 seconds |
| ccusage calls | Every update | Every 10 seconds |
| Flicker | Frequent | Eliminated |
| System load | Higher | Reduced ~80% |

root@cms4life /root $ ðŸŒ¿ main  ðŸ¤– Opus 4.1 (20250805)  ðŸ“Ÿ v1.0.89  ðŸŽ¨ default
